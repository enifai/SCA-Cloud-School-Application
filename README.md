# SCA-Cloud-School-Application

Faith Enilama Project Work Submission Code 

For source code i used (git). 
The repo is hosted on GitHub.
I added the link to the repository in my config file, then added my GitHub credentials for authentication. 

For build step 
- I executed a shell script to compile the java app using the java compiler (javac)
- the project was configured to use scheduled builds which builds the repository once every hour

For deploy 
- the task (question 1) didn't have a deployment step, so my compiled artifact is simply stored on my Jenkins server.
